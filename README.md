## Description

_This application will ask the user a series of five questions, from which it will then formulate the best programming track to pursue for that particular user_

* _In that directory I created a css folder, index.html, js/scripts.js and linked boostrap and javascripts in my index.html_
* _At this point I started to create the bare bones of my webpage by putting in the HTML_
* _Once I had the the general look of my webpage, I tried to add jQuery functionality to it._
